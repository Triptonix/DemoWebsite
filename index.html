    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>4:19 Fishing is a non-profit philantoripal website created by Hayden Luke Meherg and dedicated to the memory of David Andrew Heard. The basis for 4:19 fishing is verse Matthew 4:19 which states, "As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. Come, follow Me, Jesus said, and I will make you fishers of men. And at once they left their nets and followed Him". The values of this verse (Matthew 4:19) are directly what we represent. This website provides valuable information on water safety. tournaments, and other events. The goal of this site is to simply bring different individuals together through the shared passion of fishing and to make memories you can cherish for a lifetime. The website is still in progress, but we hope to everything functional as soon as possible. Thanks!</p>
